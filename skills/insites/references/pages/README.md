# Pages (Controllers)

Pages in Insites act as **controllers**. They live in `app/views/pages/`, fetch data via `{% graphql %}`, and delegate all rendering to partials via `{% render %}`. Pages never contain HTML, JS, or CSS directly.

## Key Purpose

Pages are the entry point for every HTTP request in a Insites application. They serve three roles:

1. **Route handling** -- each file maps to a URL endpoint with a single HTTP method
2. **Data fetching** -- pages call GraphQL queries/mutations to interact with the database
3. **Delegation** -- pages pass fetched data to partials for rendering or processing

Think of pages as thin controllers: authenticate, fetch, delegate, done.

## When to Use

- **Creating a new URL endpoint** -- every publicly accessible route needs a page file
- **Handling form submissions** -- POST/PUT/DELETE actions each get their own page
- **Building API endpoints** -- use `.json.liquid` extension for JSON responses
- **Serving dynamic content** -- combine GraphQL data fetching with partial rendering

You do NOT need a page when:
- You need a reusable UI component (use a partial instead)
- You need a shared function (use a `lib/` partial)
- You need to define data structure (use a schema table)

## How It Works

1. A request arrives at a URL (e.g., `GET /products/123`)
2. Insites matches the URL against page file slugs
3. The matching page's front matter defines method, layout, and metadata
4. The page body executes: authenticate user, run GraphQL, render partials
5. The output is wrapped in the specified layout and returned to the client

```
Request → Route Match → Front Matter → Page Body → Layout Wrap → Response
```

### Minimal page example

```liquid
---
slug: products/:id
---
{% liquid
  function profile = 'modules/user/queries/user/current'
  include 'modules/user/helpers/can_do_or_unauthorized', requester: profile, do: 'products.view'
  graphql product = 'products/find', id: context.params.id
  render 'products/show', product: product
%}
```

## Getting Started

1. Create a file in `app/views/pages/` (e.g., `app/views/pages/products/index.liquid`)
2. Add front matter with `slug` and optionally `method` and `layout`
3. Write the controller logic using `{% liquid %}` block
4. Fetch data with `{% graphql %}` and delegate with `{% render %}`
5. Run `insites-cli deploy` or use `insites-cli gui serve` to test locally

### File naming conventions

| Action  | File                         | Method | Slug               |
|---------|------------------------------|--------|---------------------|
| List    | `products/index.liquid`      | GET    | `products`          |
| Show    | `products/show.liquid`       | GET    | `products/:id`      |
| New     | `products/new.liquid`        | GET    | `products/new`      |
| Create  | `products/create.liquid`     | POST   | `products`          |
| Edit    | `products/edit.liquid`       | GET    | `products/:id/edit` |
| Update  | `products/update.liquid`     | PUT    | `products/:id`      |
| Delete  | `products/delete.liquid`     | DELETE | `products/:id`      |

### File extensions and content types

| Extension          | Content-Type             | URL        |
|--------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| `.liquid`          | `text/html`              | `/path`    |
| `.html.liquid`     | `text/html`              | `/path`    |
| `.json.liquid`     | `application/json`       | `/path.json` |
| `.js.liquid`       | `application/javascript` | `/path.js` |
